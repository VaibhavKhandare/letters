### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**

- Back of tongue raised **even higher** than for उ
- Gets **very close** to soft palate
- Creates **narrower** channel at back
- More muscular tension
- Tongue root pulls back more

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **more rounded** than for उ
- **Tighter** circle (smaller opening)
- **More protruded** (pushed forward more)
- Like an exaggerated kiss position
- Maximum rounding for Hindi vowels

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw remains fairly closed
- Similar to उ but can be slightly tighter
- Minimal opening

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- More constricted than उ
- Vocal cords vibrate
- Can feel tension in back of throat

**5. Air Flow:**

- Through very rounded, small lip opening
- Through narrow back channel
- **Long duration** - hold twice as long as उ
- Sustained steady flow

### **Sound Quality:**

- Like 'oo' in "pool," "food," or "moon"
- Like 'u' in "rule" or "flute"
- Long, sustained sound
- Deep, hollow quality

### **Key Differences from उ:**

|Feature|उ (u)|ऊ (uu)|
|---|---|---|
|Duration|Short|Long (2x)|
|Lip rounding|Moderate|Maximum|
|Lip protrusion|Slight|More forward|
|Tongue height|High|Higher|
|Tension|Relaxed|Tense|
|Sound|"put"|"pool"|

### **Step-by-Step Production:**

1. Start with उ position
2. Round lips tighter and smaller
3. Push lips forward more
4. Raise back of tongue higher
5. Hold the sound longer

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Say उ (u) - short "oo" as in "book"
2. Say ऊ (uu) - long "oo" as in "boot"
3. Alternate: उ-ऊ-उ-ऊ
4. Notice lip position change in mirror

### **Visual Comparison:**

- उ = gentle lip rounding (like saying "oh")
- ऊ = tight lip rounding (like tight whistling position)

### **Muscle Tension:**

- उ = relatively relaxed
- ऊ = can feel tension in lips and back of tongue

**Practice Words:**

- **उ words**: उठ (uṭh) - get up, पुस्तक (pustak) - book
- **ऊ words**: दूध (duudh) - milk, ऊपर (uupar) - up/above
- **Contrast**: सुन (sun) - listen vs. सून (suun) - deserted

**Common Mistakes:**

- Not making ऊ long enough
- Not enough lip rounding difference
- Same lip position for both उ and ऊ
- Forgetting the extra protrusion

**Memory Tips:**

- उ = quick "put"
- ऊ = stretched "poooool"

**Lip Exercise:**

1. Say "oo" with relaxed lips (उ)
2. Now make kiss lips and say "oo" (ऊ)
3. Feel the difference!

The main differences are LENGTH, TIGHTER ROUNDING, and MORE PROTRUSION!
