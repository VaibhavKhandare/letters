### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**

- **Front part** of tongue (not the tip) is raised **high**
- Moves close to the **hard palate** (front roof of mouth)
- Tongue tip stays behind lower teeth
- Sides of tongue touch the upper molars
- Creates a narrow channel for air

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **spread** sideways (like a smile)
- NOT rounded
- Corners of mouth pull back slightly
- Teeth may show slightly

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw is **nearly closed**
- Much less open than for अ or आ
- Teeth are close together (less than 1 finger width)

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- Throat is constricted compared to आ
- Vocal cords vibrate
- Less space in the mouth overall

**5. Air Flow:**

- Air flows through narrow channel
- Between raised tongue and palate
- Short duration (it's a short vowel)

### **Sound Quality:**

- Like 'i' in "bit" or "sit"
- NOT like 'ee' in "see" (that would be ई)
- Short, crisp sound
- High-pitched compared to अ and आ

### **Step-by-Step Production:**

1. Start from neutral position
2. Spread your lips slightly (subtle smile)
3. Raise the front of your tongue high
4. Keep tongue tip down
5. Make a short "i" sound

### **Key Points:**

- This is a **short** vowel
- **Front** vowel (made in front of mouth)
- **High** vowel (tongue is high)
- **Unrounded** (lips spread, not round)

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Say आ (aah) - notice open mouth, low tongue
2. Now say इ (i) - notice closed mouth, high tongue
3. Feel the dramatic difference in tongue height

### **Comparison:**

- **अ** = neutral position
- **आ** = low and open
- **इ** = high and front

**Practice Words:**

- इस (is) - this
- दिन (din) - day
- मिल (mil) - meet
- किताब (kitaab) - book

**Common Mistakes:**

- Don't make it too long (that's ई)
- Don't round your lips
- Make sure tongue is high enough
- Keep it crisp and short

**Helpful Tip:** Think of the word "it" in English - the 'i' sound is very close to इ!
