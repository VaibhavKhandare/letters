### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**
- Starts **low-back** (like आ position)
- **Glides upward and backward** toward उ
- Clear movement from low to high
- Back of mouth throughout
- Dynamic movement

**2. Lip Position:**
- Start with lips **unrounded/neutral**
- Gradually **round** during the glide
- End with moderate-tight rounding
- Clear lip movement from flat to round

**3. Jaw Position:**
- Starts **open** (like for आ)
- **Closes** during the glide
- Ends nearly closed (like for उ)
- Significant jaw movement

**4. Air Flow:**
- Continuous flow
- Longer duration than ओ
- Sound clearly changes during production

### **Sound Quality:**
- Like 'ou' in "house" or "out"
- Like 'ow' in "cow" or "now"
- Starts with "ah" sound, glides to "oo"
- Clear diphthong (two sounds combined)

### **The Gliding Motion:**
```
Start: आ position (low, open, unrounded)
    ↓
Glide through: ओ position (medium)
    ↓
End near: उ position (high, back, rounded)
```

### **Key Differences from ओ:**

| Feature | ओ (o) | औ (au) |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Starting point | Mid-back | Low-back |
| Lip start | Already rounded | Unrounded |
| Movement | Slight glide | Clear glide |
| Sound | "go" | "cow" |
| Jaw movement | Minimal | Significant |

### **Step-by-Step Production:**
1. Start with आ - mouth open, lips flat
2. Say "ahhh"
3. While voicing, gradually:
   - Round your lips
   - Raise back of tongue
   - Close your jaw
4. End near उ position
5. One smooth motion: "ahh-oo"

### **Visual Path:**
- Mouth: Open → Closing
- Lips: Flat → Rounding
- Tongue: Low back → High back
- Like a mirror image of ऐ

### **Comparison with ऐ:**
| ऐ (ai) | औ (au) |
|---------|---------|
| Front glide | Back glide |
| Lips spread | Lips round |
| "ice" | "house" |

### **Practice Exercise:**
1. Say आ (aa) - starting position
2. Say उ (u) - ending position
3. Connect smoothly: आ → उ = औ
4. Compare with ओ - notice औ has more movement

### **Common Mistakes:**
- Making it too much like ओ (not enough glide)
- Starting with rounded lips (should start flat)
- Not enough lip movement
- Separating into two sounds

**Practice Words:**
- और (aur) - and
- कौन (kaun) - who
- पौधा (paudhaa) - plant
- सौ (sau) - hundred

### **Slow Motion Practice:**
1. "ahhh" (hold, lips flat)
2. "ahhh-ooo" (glide slowly, round lips)
3. "au" (normal speed)

### **All Diphthongs Comparison:**
- ऐ (ai): आ → इ (front glide, lips spread)
- औ (au): आ → उ (back glide, lips round)

### **Mirror Exercise:**
Watch your lips transform:
1. Start: Relaxed/flat (like आ)
2. Middle: Starting to round
3. End: Rounded (like उ)

### **Memory Tips:**
- ओ = "boat" (slight glide)
- औ = "house" (clear glide from open to rounded)
