### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**
- **Back-middle** part of tongue is raised
- **Medium-high** position (between उ and अ)
- Not as high as उ, higher than अ
- Back of mouth activity
- Slight backward pull

**2. Lip Position:**
- Lips are **rounded**
- **Medium rounding** (between अ and उ)
- Not as tight as उ/ऊ
- Like saying "oh"
- Moderate protrusion

**3. Jaw Position:**
- **Medium** opening
- More open than उ
- Less open than आ
- About 1.5 finger widths

**4. Air Flow:**
- Steady flow through rounded lips
- Medium-long duration
- Slight glide upward at end

### **Sound Quality:**
- Like 'o' in "go" or "home"
- Like 'oa' in "boat"
- Has slight glide from 'o' to 'u'
- Medium-long vowel

### **Position Comparison:**

| Feature | उ (u) | ओ (o) | आ (aa) |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| Tongue height | High back | Mid-high back | Low |
| Lip rounding | Tight | Medium | None |
| Jaw opening | Small | Medium | Large |

### **The Slight Glide:**
```
Starts at: Mid-back rounded position
Glides slightly toward: उ position
Very subtle movement
```

### **Step-by-Step Production:**
1. Start with neutral mouth
2. Round lips moderately (like saying "oh!")
3. Raise back of tongue to medium height
4. Open jaw medium amount
5. Make "o" sound with slight upward glide

### **Visual Cues:**
- Lip shape: Like surprise "Oh!"
- Not as tight as whistling (that's उ/ऊ)
- Rounder than English "o"

### **Practice Exercise:**
1. Say आ (aa) - no rounding
2. Say ओ (o) - medium rounding
3. Say उ (u) - tight rounding
4. Feel the progression: आ → ओ → उ

### **Back Vowel Progression:**
Practice this sequence to feel back tongue positions:
- आ (aa) - tongue low back
- ओ (o) - tongue mid back  
- उ (u) - tongue high back

### **Common Mistakes:**
- Not rounding lips enough (sounds like ए)
- Rounding too much (sounds like उ)
- Missing the slight glide
- Making it too short

**Practice Words:**
- ओर (or) - towards
- सोना (sonaa) - gold/to sleep
- बोल (bol) - speak
- खोल (khol) - open

### **Lip Rounding Exercise:**
1. Say "आ" - lips neutral
2. Keep same tongue position
3. Now round lips - becomes "ओ"
4. Round more - becomes "उ"

### **Memory Tips:**
- Think of English "Oh!" but with rounder lips
- It's between आ and उ in every way

### **Mirror Practice:**
Watch your lips:
- ए/ऐ = lips spread
- ओ/औ = lips rounded
This is a major visual difference!

### **Contrast Practice:**
- के (ke) vs को (ko)
- मेरा (meraa) vs मोरा (moraa)
- Feel the lip change!
