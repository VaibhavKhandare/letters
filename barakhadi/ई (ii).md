### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**

- Front of tongue is raised **even higher** than for इ
- Gets **closer** to the hard palate (almost touching)
- Creates an even **narrower** channel
- More tension in the tongue
- Sides firmly pressed against upper molars

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **more spread** than for इ
- Wider smile-like position
- Corners pulled back more noticeably
- Teeth usually visible
- More tension in lips

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw is at its **most closed** position for vowels
- Teeth very close together
- Minimal opening

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- Most constricted vowel position
- Vocal cords vibrate
- Can feel tension in throat area

**5. Air Flow:**

- Through very narrow channel
- **Longer duration** - hold for twice as long as इ
- Sustained, steady airflow

### **Sound Quality:**

- Like 'ee' in "see," "meet," or "feel"
- Like 'ea' in "eat" or "heat"
- Long, sustained sound
- Higher pitched than इ

### **Key Differences from इ:**

|Feature|इ (i)|ई (ii)|
|---|---|---|
|Duration|Short|Long (2x)|
|Tongue height|High|Higher|
|Lip spread|Slight|More|
|Tension|Relaxed|Tense|
|Sound|"bit"|"beat"|

### **Step-by-Step Production:**

1. Start with इ position
2. Raise tongue even higher
3. Spread lips wider
4. Add more tension
5. Hold the sound longer

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Say इ (i) - short "i" as in "bit"
2. Say ई (ii) - long "ee" as in "beet"
3. Alternate: इ-ई-इ-ई
4. Feel the difference in duration and tension

### **Visual Comparison:**

- इ = casual smile
- ई = big cheese smile for photo

### **Muscle Tension:**

- इ = relatively relaxed
- ई = can feel tension in tongue and lips

**Practice Words:**

- **इ words**: इधर (idhar), दिल (dil)
- **ई words**: दीदी (diidii) - elder sister, नदी (nadii) - river
- **Contrast**: दिन (din) - day vs. दीन (diin) - poor

**Common Mistakes:**

- Not making ई long enough
- Not enough difference in tongue height
- Forgetting the extra tension

**Memory Tip:**

- इ = quick "it"
- ई = stretched "eeeeeat"

The main difference is LENGTH and TENSION. ई is just इ held longer with more muscle tension!
