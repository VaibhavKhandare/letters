### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**

- Tongue lies **flat** and **low** in the mouth
- Even lower than for अ
- Tip still rests behind lower teeth
- The back of tongue is pulled down and back slightly

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **open wider** than for अ
- Still neutral - not rounded or spread
- Natural, relaxed position

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw drops **significantly more** than for अ
- Mouth opens wider (about 2-3 finger widths)
- This is one of the most open vowel positions

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- Throat is fully open
- Vocal cords vibrate
- You can feel more space in your throat

**5. Air Flow:**

- Free, unobstructed flow
- Longer duration than अ
- More air comes out due to wider opening

### **Sound Quality:**

- Like 'a' in "father" or "car" (in American English)
- Like 'a' in "bath" (in British English)
- This is a **long vowel** - hold it twice as long as अ
- Open, clear sound

### **Key Difference from अ:**

- **अ** = short, neutral, small opening ("uh")
- **आ** = long, open, wide opening ("aah")

### **Step-by-Step Production:**

1. Start with अ position
2. Drop your jaw more
3. Open your mouth wider
4. Pull tongue slightly back and down
5. Make a longer "aah" sound

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Say अ (uh) - short
2. Now open wider and say आ (aah) - long
3. Alternate: अ-आ-अ-आ

### **Visual Cue:**

Imagine you're at the doctor saying "aah" for a throat examination - that's आ!

**Practice Words:**

- आम (aam) - mango
- आज (aaj) - today
- काम (kaam) - work
- आना (aanaa) - to come

**Common Mistakes:**

- Don't make it too short (that becomes अ)
- Don't round your lips (that would move toward ओ)
- Make sure it's clearly longer than अ
