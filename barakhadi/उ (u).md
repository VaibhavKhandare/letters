**1. Tongue Position:**

- **Back part** of tongue is raised high (like for क)
- Moves toward the **soft palate** (back roof of mouth)
- Tongue tip relaxed, behind lower teeth
- Creates narrow channel at the back
- Complete shift from front (इ/ई) to back of mouth

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **rounded** (like whistling position)
- Pushed forward slightly
- Small circular opening
- NOT spread like for इ/ई
- Moderate rounding (not extreme)

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw fairly closed
- Similar to इ position
- Teeth close together
- Small mouth opening

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- Throat slightly constricted
- Vocal cords vibrate
- Back of mouth space is narrow

**5. Air Flow:**

- Through rounded lip opening
- And through narrow back channel
- Short duration (short vowel)

### **Sound Quality:**

- Like 'u' in "put" or "push"
- Like 'oo' in "book" or "look"
- NOT like 'oo' in "pool" (that's ऊ)
- Short, rounded sound

### **Major Change from Previous Vowels:**

|Feature|इ/ई|उ|
|---|---|---|
|Tongue part|Front raised|Back raised|
|Lips|Spread|Rounded|
|Location|Front vowel|Back vowel|

### **Step-by-Step Production:**

1. Start from neutral
2. Round your lips (like starting to whistle)
3. Pull tongue back
4. Raise back of tongue high
5. Make short "u" sound

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Say इ (i) - feel tongue front, lips spread
2. Say उ (u) - feel tongue back, lips round
3. Alternate to feel the shift: इ-उ-इ-उ

### **Visual Cue:**

Make the lip shape for blowing out a candle gently - that's the lip position for उ!

### **Key Points:**

- **Short** vowel (not long)
- **Back** vowel (made in back of mouth)
- **High** vowel (tongue is high)
- **Rounded** (lips in circle)

**Practice Words:**

- उस (us) - that/him/her
- गुरु (guru) - teacher (first 'u' is उ)
- सुन (sun) - listen
- मुख (mukh) - face

**Common Mistakes:**

- Making it too long (that's ऊ)
- Not rounding lips enough
- Using front of tongue instead of back
- Making lip opening too big

**Contrast Practice:**

- इ (i) = "bit" (front, spread)
- उ (u) = "put" (back, rounded)

**Helpful Tip:** Think of "push" or "pull" - the 'u' sound in these words is very close to उ!
