## ** - Visarga**

### **Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Basic Position:**
- Start with **अ (a)** position (or any vowel)
- Mouth maintains the vowel shape
- Key action happens at the **glottis** (voice box)

**2. Glottis/Throat Action:**
- After the vowel, **release a puff of air**
- Vocal cords **stop vibrating**
- Like a soft, breathy 'h'
- Voiceless breath release

**3. Lip Position:**
- Stays in the **vowel position**
- For अः: lips neutral
- No special lip movement
- Just air release

**4. Tongue Position:**
- Maintains **vowel position**
- No movement needed
- Stays relaxed for अः

**5. The Breath Release:**
- It's like a **soft sigh**
- Unvoiced air puff
- Like 'h' but even softer
- No friction in mouth

### **How It Works:**

```
Step 1: Say the vowel (अ)
Step 2: Cut off voice
Step 3: Release soft breath
Result: अः (aḥ)
```

### **With Different Vowels:**

| Vowel + ः | Sound | Example |
|----------|--------|----------|
| अः (aḥ) | a + h | नमः (namaḥ) |
| आः (āḥ) | aa + h | छाः (chāḥ) |
| इः (iḥ) | i + h | मुनिः (muniḥ) |
| उः (uḥ) | u + h | गुरुः (guruḥ) |

### **Step-by-Step Production:**
1. Say अ (a) normally
2. Stop voicing suddenly
3. Let out gentle breath
4. Like saying "a" then breathing out
5. Don't make it too strong

### **Practice Exercise:**
1. Say "अ" (a) - normal vowel
2. Say "अह" (aha) - with 'h' sound
3. Say "अः" (aḥ) - softer than ह
4. It's between stopping and 'h'

### **Difference from ह (ha):**

| Feature | ह (ha) | ः (visarga) |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Voice | Voiced start | Voiceless |
| Strength | Clear 'h' | Soft breath |
| Position | Consonant | After vowel only |
| Sound | "ha" | Just breath |

### **Common Mistakes:**
- Making it too strong (like ह)
- Adding voice (should be voiceless)
- Making it too long
- Closing mouth after vowel

### **Feel the Difference:**
1. Put hand in front of mouth
2. Say अ - minimal air
3. Say अः - feel soft air puff
4. Say अह - stronger air with 'h'

### **Breath Control Exercise:**
- "अ..." (hold vowel)
- Cut voice, release air: "...ः"
- Like end of a gentle sigh

**Practice Words:**
- नमः (namaḥ) - salutation
- अतः (ataḥ) - therefore
- पुनः (punaḥ) - again
- प्रातः (prātaḥ) - morning

### **In Sanskrit vs Hindi:**
- More common in Sanskrit
- In Hindi, often silent or very light
- Sometimes written but not pronounced

### **Memory Tips:**
- Think of a soft sigh after vowel
- Like whispering the end
- Gentler than English 'h'

### **The Two Dots (:) Represent:**
- Two puffs of air
- Voiceless release
- End of breath

### **Compare All Three:**
1. अ (a) - just vowel
2. अं (aṃ) - vowel + nasal
3. अः (aḥ) - vowel + breath
