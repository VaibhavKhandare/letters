**Detailed Mouth Position:**

**1. Tongue Position:**

- Tongue is completely **relaxed** and **neutral**
- Lies flat in the middle of your mouth
- Tip rests gently behind your lower teeth
- Not touching the roof of mouth anywhere

**2. Lip Position:**

- Lips are **neutral** - not rounded, not spread
- Relaxed and slightly apart
- Natural position like when you're about to speak

**3. Jaw Position:**

- Jaw is relaxed and slightly open
- Teeth are apart (about 1-2 finger widths)
- Most neutral position possible

**4. Throat/Glottis:**

- Throat is open
- Vocal cords vibrate (it's a voiced sound)
- No tension anywhere

**5. Air Flow:**

- Smooth, unobstructed flow
- Comes straight from the lungs through open throat

### **Sound Quality:**

- This is the most basic vowel sound in Hindi
- Sounds like 'u' in "but" or "cut" (in British English)
- Shorter than the 'a' in "father"
- It's a **schwa** sound [ə] in linguistic terms

### **Important Note:**

This is NOT like the English 'a' in "apple" or "father". It's a very short, neutral sound.

### **Practice Exercise:**

1. Completely relax your mouth
2. Open it slightly
3. Make a short "uh" sound
4. That's अ!

### **Common Mistakes:**

- Don't make it too long (that would be आ)
- Don't round your lips
- Don't tense any part of your mouth

**Practice Words:**

- अब (ab) - now
- कल (kal) - yesterday/tomorrow (the 'a' here is अ)
- अगर (agar) - if
